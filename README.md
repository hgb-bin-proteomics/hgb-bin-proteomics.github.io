## Projects

Here is an overview of projects that we have published on GitHub:

- ### MS Amanda

  MS Amanda is a scoring system to identify peptides out of tandem mass spectrometry data using a database of known proteins:

- ### MS Ana

  MS Ana is a scoring system to identify peptides in tandem mass spectrometry data using a library of previously identified spectra. Furthermore, MS Ana can create decoy spectral libraries for validation and run searches for additional modifications not found in the spectral library.:

- ### MS Annika

  MS Annika is a crosslink search engine based on MS Amanda, aimed at identifying crosslinks of cleavable and non-cleavable crosslinkers from MS2 and MS3 spectra:

- ### pyXLMS

  pyXLMS is a python package and web application with graphical user interface that aims to simplify and streamline the intermediate step of connecting crosslink search engine results with down-stream analysis tools:
